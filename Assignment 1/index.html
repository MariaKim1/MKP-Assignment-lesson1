    <h1>Maria's coding journey!</h1>
    <p><br>
    <h3><span>Day 1: </span>Let's kick it!! Or not..</h3>
        My first day Lilo woke up with a fever so I had to stay home with her. Poor little thing.<br>
        Luckily I had some time in the evening to catch up.<br> 
    <br>
    <h3><span>Day 2: </span>Our first lesson was an introduction to HTML</h3> 
        I downloaded Visual Studio Code which is a program 
        where you write code. 
        <br>
        I installed some helpfull plug-ins to VSC. HTML Hint which will help you remember what 
        tags needs a closing tab, and by that help you to write cleaner code.<br>
        I also installed Live Server which will automaticly update your website as you save code in VSC.<br>
        <br>
        Also, we needed to start learning Git and GitHub since this is where we submit all of our assignments.<br>
        Gahhh.. why doesn't it work the way I understand it to work..!?<br> 
        <br>

    <h4><span>HTML - Single tags of the day: </span></h4>
            break - <br>   
    <h4><span>HTML - Double tags of the day: </span></h4>
            head - this is where all meta-info goes so that the website knows how to "exist" online<br> 
            body - everything we see on the website is in the body tag.<br>
            paragraf - I don't really get this tag, or when to use it or why. Maybe it was just for organizing code<br>
            headline1-6 - <br>
            span - <br>
    <h4><span>Git-kode/commands: </span></h4>
            git commit - <br>
            git branch - <br>
            git checkout - <br>
            git branch - <br>
            git merge - <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h3><span>My take away's from today:</span></h3>
        I need to get Git and Github more. I've seen some great tutorials, but I need to practice and more practice!<br>
        I'd like to learn more do's and don't's when it comes to organizing my code.
